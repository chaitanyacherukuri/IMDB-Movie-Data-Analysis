In this project, I conducted my own data analysis on the IMDB dataset and created a jupyter notebook file to share that documents my findings. I started the data analysis process by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy libraries to perform data wrangling on the dataset to make the data ready for my analysis and answer the questions that I am most interested in. I used a Jupyter notebook, to share my findings alongside the code I used to perform the analysis and also made sure that the report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish the comments and findings from code work.
